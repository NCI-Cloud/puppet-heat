features:
  - |
    The new ``heat::trustee`` class has been added. This class supports
    parameters define in the ``trustee`` section.

deprecations:
  - |
    The ``heat::trustee`` class should be included to manage ``trustee``
    option. This class is included by the ``heat`` class and the parameters are
    defined automatically based on the ``heat::keystone::authtoken`` class to
    keep compatibility but this behavior will be removed in a future release.
