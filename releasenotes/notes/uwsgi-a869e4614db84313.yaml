    Two new classes heat::wsgi::uwsgi_api and heat::wsgi::uwsgi_api_cfn
    exist to allow configuring uwsgi in operating systems that support
    this (ie: currently Debian). This helps configuring the number of
    processes, threads and listen socket. Also, two new
    heat_api_uwsgi_config and heat_api_cfn_uwsgi_config providers now
    exist.
